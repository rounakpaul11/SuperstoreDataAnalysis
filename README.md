## Python Interactive Dashboard Development with Streamlit and Plotly

This repository contains code and resources for building an interactive Python dashboard using Streamlit and Plotly. Streamlit is a popular Python library for creating interactive web applications and dashboards, while Plotly is used for data visualization.

## Introduction

In this project, we leverage the capabilities of Streamlit and Plotly to develop a dynamic and user-friendly dashboard for analyzing sales data from a retail superstore. The dashboard allows users to upload raw data, visualize sales trends, perform time series analysis, apply filters, and download or view data based on plots.

## Key Features

- **Rapid Prototyping:** Streamlit simplifies the process of building data-driven applications with its intuitive interface.
- **Data Visualization:** Plotly enables interactive and visually appealing data visualizations.
- **User Interaction:** The dashboard provides user-friendly features such as date pickers and multiple select filters.
- **Integration with Machine Learning Models:** Streamlit seamlessly integrates with machine learning models for predictive analysis.
- **Sharing and Deployment:** Streamlit dashboards can be easily shared and deployed, making it convenient for collaboration and showcasing insights.

## Content Overview

This repository includes:

- Python code for creating the interactive dashboard using Streamlit and Plotly.
- Sample dataset (Superstore.xls) for analyzing sales data.
